    "Occam's razor, also known as the law of parsimony, is perhaps one of the most important principles of all science. The theory based upon the least assumptions tends to be the correct one. In the case of machine learning, a corollary condition could be proposed; *the best machine learning models not only require the best performance metrics, but should also require the least amount of data and processing time as well.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, my objective was to built a model with the highest performance metrics (accuracy and F1 score) using the least amount of data and operating in the shortest amount of time.\n",

    "Categorizing something as poisnous versus edible wouldn't be a problem taken lightly. If you had any  margin of error, someone could die. Thus, any model that predicts whether or not a mushroom is poisonous or edible needs to have perfect accuracy. At a glance, this is the goal of the data - figure out what to eat versus toss; a typical problem in classification.\n",

    "The data itsself was entirely categorical and nominal in structure. In all, the data included 8124 observational rows, and (before cleaning) 23 categorical features. The features were themselves had letter values, with no order structure between the letters. Out of the 8124 rows, 4208 were classified as edible and 3916 were poisonous.
